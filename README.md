## Biography 

My preferred biography:

> James Turnbull is the CTO at Empatico, an education technology startup building tools to help elementary students develop empathy skills. A longtime member of the open source community, James is the author of eleven technical books about open source software including Monitoring with Prometheus, The Terraform Book, The Art of Monitoring, The Logstash Book, and The Docker Book. He was formerly CTO at Kickstarter and an engineering leader at Venmo, Docker, Puppet, National Australia Bank and an advisor at Access Now and Docker. James likes food, wine, books, photography, and cats. He is not overly keen on long walks on the beach or holding hands.
